## 👋 Hi, I’m Alejandro (Alex) Reyes

I’m a Computer Science graduate focused on **data analytics, finance, and building real-world systems** that turn raw information into meaningful insight. I love working at the intersection of **data, software, and decision-making**, where technical depth meets practical impact.

---

### 👀 What I’m Interested In
- 📊 Data Analytics & Data Science  
- 📈 Quantitative Finance & Risk Analysis  
- 🤖 Applied Machine Learning & Automation  
- 🧠 Turning complex data into clear, actionable stories  

I’m a big believer in **data-driven decisions**, but not in the sense to get better numbers. What gets us the better outcome in the world!

---

### 🛠️ Tech I Work With
- **Languages:** Python, R, C++, TypeScript  
- **Data & ML:** Pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, statistical modeling, time-series analysis  
- **Web & Systems:** React, Django, Flask, SQL, REST APIs  
- **Tools:** Git, VS Code, Linux, Jupyter, RStudio  

Always learning, always refining — I care just as much about *how* something is built as *what* it does.

---

### 🎢 Outside of Tech
When I’m not coding or analyzing data, you’ll probably find me:
- Off-roading 🚙  
- Camping 🏕️  
- Eating good food with family & friends 🍽️  

Those experiences keep me grounded and fuel the creativity I bring back into my work.
